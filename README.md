# UrbanEyes: Transforming Community Issue Reporting

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind UrbanEyes was driven by the inefficiencies and complexities in current neighborhood issue reporting processes. We observed that reporting community issues, such as potholes, fallen electric lines, and water supply disruptions, was often burdensome and time-consuming for residents. This realization motivated us to create a platform that simplifies the process, making it accessible to all. Our mission is to empower community members by providing them with a tool that facilitates transparent communication and encourages proactive engagement in addressing local concerns.

## What It Does
UrbanEyes is a comprehensive community issue management and reporting app. It allows users to:

- Report Issues: Easily submit reports for problems like potholes, fallen electric lines, and water supply damage.
- View Issues on a Map: See reported issues displayed live on an interactive map.
- Track Status: Monitor the status of reported issues in real-time.
- Upvote and Downvote: Engage with the community by upvoting or downvoting issues.
- Track and Manage Issues: Keep track of reported issues, including those they have reported themselves.

## How We Built It
The development of UrbanEyes was a collaborative effort involving various technologies and methodologies:

- Frontend Development: We used React Native to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Backend Development: Django was employed to create a robust and scalable backend system.
- Integration: REST APIs were used to connect the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless data flow.
- Database Management: Airtable was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in managing our data.

Our process began with creating detailed wireframes, followed by iterative development and testing to refine the application.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We faced several challenges throughout the project:

- Virtual Collaboration: Coordinating efforts across different time zones required careful planning and effective communication.
- Complex Issues: Resolving issues that involved multiple team members was challenging, especially when tasks were interdependent.
- Technical Hurdles: Integrating various technologies and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend posed technical difficulties. Despite these challenges, our team demonstrated resilience and adaptability, working together to overcome obstacles and achieve our project goals.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud of several key accomplishments:

- Successful Integration: We achieved seamless integration between the React Native frontend and the Django backend using REST APIs.
- User-Friendly Design: The app features an intuitive and responsive design, enhancing user experience.
- Community Engagement: UrbanEyes has the potential to significantly improve how community issues are reported and managed, fostering greater engagement and accountability.

## What We Learned Throughout the development of UrbanEyes, we gained valuable insights and skills:
- Technical Proficiency: We deepened our understanding of Django, React Native, and REST API integration.
- Team Collaboration: We learned the importance of effective virtual teamwork and communication, especially across different time zones.
- Problem-Solving: We developed problem-solving skills by tackling complex technical and collaborative challenges.

## What's Next for UrbanEyes
UrbanEyes is more than just an app; itâ€™s a platform that fosters community engagement and promotes collective responsibility. By streamlining the issue reporting process, we aim to create a more responsive and accountable environment for all residents.

Looking ahead, we plan to:

- Enhance Features: Introduce additional features and improvements based on user feedback and emerging needs.
- Expand Reach: Explore opportunities to deploy UrbanEyes in new communities and regions.
- Continual Improvement: Regularly update the app to address any issues and incorporate new technologies and best practices. Our vision for UrbanEyes is to continually evolve and enhance its impact, creating a more responsive and engaged community.

We are excited about the positive impact UrbanEyes will have and look forward to seeing our community thrive as a result of our efforts.
